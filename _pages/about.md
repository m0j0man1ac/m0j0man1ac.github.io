### Hey Visitor!
Welcome and thanks for taking the time to check out my site. I'm Ryan and I enjoy making things. Just starting out my career in Programming and Game Development.

What's drawn me to programming is how its an intersection between creativity and logic. You can build something interactive, useable, whether to solve practical problems or create new unique experiences. Games especially combine many disciplines to create a compelling product. As a long-time gamer, watching others get their hands on your creations is really satisfying.

The things I have a special interest in are system design, emergent gameplay, simulation and graphics programming. I spend my time tinkering and game jamming, trying to pick up and learn as much as I can.

Though I don't play as much recently, I've been playing games since I was a kid and across many genres. The types of games I've enjoyed the most and have left the biggest impact on me have been: RPGs, Action RPGs, Strategy & TRPGs, Immersive Sims and Coop Multiplayer experiences. My favorite game is definitely Outer Wilds and I'm still slowly working my way through Baldur's Gate 3 but it's been a great time.  

Please take a look around at my projects and hope you have a good one.
